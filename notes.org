* May 6
  description logics as predicate_names is problematic
  can't reason between them
* May 7
  conditions can be used to check implications
  multiple models can have different conclusions
  - could probaply check for things that hold in every answer
* May 8
** Morning meeting
  need to differentiate between logics and how properties don't transfer
  have one stable model for the base model
  having description logics as constants
* May 12
  heirarchy can be made by implementing partial order relations
* May 15
  addition: taks_reduction
  Query answering
  modeling feature
  start writing
* May 20  
  - unneeded rules of transitivity /postponed
  - in_p_space ✓
  - complexity and completeness ✓
  - higher_upper_bound ✓
  - no need to say not has_complexity ✓
  - data from navigator
  - references ✓
  - suggestions:
    - deriving feature
      more_expressives
      has_feature(b):- has_feature(a). 
    - deriving properties, nominals -> tbox -> reasoning about complexities
    - deriving reductions
* June 2
  - add references as a separate predicate
  - add some general reductions
* June 16
  writing reports 
  more data
  upper bounds the same  ✓
  add a gui
* June 26
  - wishlist:-
    - conjunctive query answering as reasoning task not alot of data ✓
    - finite model reasoning vs arbitrary ✓
    - data and combinded complexity not alot of data ✓
    - hardcoded logic names and dynamic logics/ not needed ✓ 
      since the inference rules are defined in terms of features ✓
    - link direct papers ✓
    - highest logics with the same bound and lowest with same lower bound
  - writing:
    shortcoming of the navigator
    insights of the implementation
