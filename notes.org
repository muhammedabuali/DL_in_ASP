  description logics as predicate_names is problematic
  can't reason between them
* May 7
  conditions can be used to check implications
  multiple models can have different conclusions
  - could probaply check for things that hold in every answer
* May 8
** Morning meeting
  need to differentiate between logics and how properties don't transfer
  have one stable model for the base model
  having description logics as constants
* May 12
  heirarchy can be made by implementing partial order relations

  - suggestions:
    - deriving featuremore_expressives
      has_feature(b):- has_feature(a). 
    - deriving properties, nominals -> tbox -> reasoning about complexities
    - deriving reductions
* June 2
  - add references as a separate predicate
  - add some general reductions
